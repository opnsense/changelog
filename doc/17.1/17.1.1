Hey there,

This week we are introducing a number of reliability fixes especially with
regard to our move to FreeBSD 11.0 and PHP 7.0; most prominently a NAT fix
for the shared filter forwarding and repairing the CRL generation.  You will
also find a few interesting IPsec additions.  ;)

In case the shared forwarding is still giving you trouble on 17.1.1, run
the following command to use the old behaviour and report back to us:

# sysctl net.pf.share_forward=0

Here are the full patch notes:

  security tokens
