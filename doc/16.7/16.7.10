Dear friends and followers,

Another week, another update.  We are addressing two regressions caught
by our users and update the ports to their latest versions including NTP,
Squid, and strongSwan.  As always, thank you for your support!

This update also enables console upgrades for the development version
into the upcoming 17.1-BETA, which will be published right after we finish
the WiFi configuration and the last known trouble with PHP 7.0 in the GUI
pages.  Please make sure you understand the implications of upgrading to
BETA.  Release notes will be published along with it as soon as it is out.
