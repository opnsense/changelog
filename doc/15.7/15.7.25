Hi everyone,

This is good-bye.  6 months have passed and 15.7 has served us well.
In only 10 days 16.1 will be out and it is looking shiny.  Please study
the end of life announcement on the firmware page before attempting to
upgrade to the next version.

As such, we have incorporated all of the outstanding security issues
of last week, mostly related to FreeBSD and OpenSSH.  Patches for the
GUI are light; all pending improvements go directly into the next major
release.

Here are the full patch notes:

o src: SCTP ICMPv6 error message vulnerability[1]
o src: ntp panic threshold bypass vulnerability[2]
o src: Linux compatibility layer incorrect futex handling[3]
o src: Linux compatibility layer setgroups(2) system call vulnerability[4]
o src: TCP MD5 signature denial of service[5]
o src: Insecure default snmpd.config permissions[6]
o src: OpenSSH client information leak[7]
o src: Invalid TCP checksums with pf(4)[8]
o src: YP/NIS client library critical bug[9]
o ports: sqlite 3.10.0[10], easy-rsa 3.0.1[11], openssh-portable 7.1p2[12]
o traffic graphs: fix truncation of IP address to 14 characters
o firmware: EOL announcement for 15.7 added, ready for upgrading to
  16.1 on January 28
o firmware: added mirror provided by RageNetwork (Munich, DE)
o menu: fix navigation after editing IPsec mobile clients (contributed
  by Manuel Faux)
o trust: properly reference CA in intermediate CAs (contributed by
  Manuel Faux)


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
