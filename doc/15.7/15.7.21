Hello everyone,

Back in September we've started out to work on the excessive GUI padding
and dispersed menu structure in order to get to a slick and clean page
layout.  We've transformed tab navigation into submenu items, pulling
similar items together into one single category, adding distinctive icons
as a highlight and anchor point.  We've come to like it so much that we
can't wait for 16.1 to merge it in so here it is for everyone to enjoy.
Work in this area will continue in tiny pieces as we go along.  Send us
feedback, let us know what we can push even further.

15.7.21 brings updates to some of the most important ports and RRD frontend
pages have been completely removed.  Unfortunately, we couldn't squeeze in
OpenSSL and LibreSSL at this point, but will follow up as soon as both of
them are available.

Here are the full patch notes:
