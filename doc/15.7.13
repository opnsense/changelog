Hello there,

15.7.13 is a short GUI-only update since we've seen frequent validation
errors in our crash reports.  We've fixed that ahead of schedule and also
push a larger under-the-hood preparation of the coming firewall section
and menu rework while at it.  Exciting stuff coming soon.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

o diagnostics: added real backend code leading to upcoming privilege
  separation for pfInfo, pfTop, States and Tables pages
o dynamic dns: introduce constant naming away from "DynDNS" or "DDNS"
o gui: fix numerous typos spotted by our relentless translators
o gui: fixed validation errors in new components
o gui: removed partial shadow from active tab
o ipsec: fixed missing redirect after apply


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
