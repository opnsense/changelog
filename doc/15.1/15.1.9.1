Dear all,

Today we present you a quiet stable update with a hand full of assorted
features, tweaks and bug fixes.  Most notably, we've integrated DNS filtering
via OpenDNS and tested / reworked the IPSec reporting.

As far as we know there have been no security-related fixes of bundled
third-party software since 15.1.9.

Update through the GUI via "System: Firmware" or the root console option
"12) Upgrade from console".  A reboot is not strictly required, but
recommended to trigger the automatic enable of soft updates and TRIM
(if applicable to your disk).

Here is the full change log of 15.1.9.1:

o firmware: show a warning on pending system updates that need to be executed
  from the console
o system: "General Setup" and "Advanced" items have been merged into "Settings"
o system: "Certificate Manager" is now known as "Certificates", default tab
  changed as well
o services: introduce OpenDNS-based DNS filtering
o services: fixed start button layout when service is offline
o ports: fixed StrongSwan SMP socket bind on FreeBSD
o ipsec: brought back tunnel status reporting
o ipsec: fixed "Do not install LAN SPD" setting
o user manager: fixed group permission and privilege read bugs
o wake on lan: fixed "Cannot create references to/from string offsets nor
  overloaded objects" error
o openvpn: fixed server restart regression
o core: automatically enable TRIM on boot if available

The update is not available via install media, but you can just as well
download 15.1.9 from a mirror and upgrade with a few simple clicks:
