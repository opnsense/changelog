Hi everyone,

A tiny batch of fixes comes bundled with today's 15.1.11.3 mainly to
increase stability during WiFi USB attach/detach.  It is a work in
progress so please let us know how your experience changes.

Here are the full patch notes:

o config: improved the deletion of backups
o wifi: do not launch FreeBSD's rc scripts on 802.11 attach/detach
o ipfw: always forward traffic coming from localhost
o system: apply PSR2 coding style to GUI pages
o captive portal: apply PSR2 coding style to GUI pages


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
