@ July 24, 2018

Dear all,

It is that time of the year again: this update is the last one in the
18.1 series and 18.7, nicknamed "Happy Hippo", will be released next week!

The transition will be seamless when heeding the upgrade notes to be
published with the 18.7 images on July 31.  All 18.7-RC users will be
able to upgrade right away.  After a number of hours we will enable the
upgrade path with a small hotfix to 18.1.13.  This process may take up
to 24 hours so please do not be alarmed about delays.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: restart syslog when interface bind addresses may have changed
o system: remove unused action_disable setting in gateway monitoring
o firmware: new mirror Dataroute (Dusseldorf, DE)
o ntp: typo in SiRF selection
o openvpn: translate validated field names
o rc: unset rcvar before evaluation (contributed by Nicholas de Jong)
o installer: give basic tip that GUI IP can be set in console after install (contributed by stilez)
o plugins: os-theme-cicada 1.2 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-theme-rebellion 1.2 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-theme-tukan 1.1 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o ports: suricata 4.0.5[1]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
