Howdy partners,

With Meltdown and Spectre just behind us here comes another round of
security advisories and assorted changes.

Three mentionable changes are included: We are switching back to
single-source automatic outbound NAT on the primary IP instead of
using all additional VIPs on the interface as was the case with
OPNsense 17.7 and earlier.  The hardware-assisted VLAN capability
check was removed from the system enabling e.g. XEN users to create
VLANs.  And the multi-WAN traffic shaping experience has been
corrected for non-default interfaces within the scope of shared
forwarding.

Expected is an image release based on this version some time within
the next week for completeness.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: reverse reload order for gateway switching on OpenVPN
