Hi guys,

We expect all of you are doing well?  It has been a longer while
since the last update so 16.1.9 has got a bit of everything to
keep the spirits high.  :)

There is tremendous progress in the translations.  It just so
happens that we now have a comprehensive Russian translation as
well which is going to be completed in the upcoming weeks.  Many
thanks to Smart-Soft Ltd. for making this happen.  The contender
is Japanese through the work of Chie Taguchi, who did most of the
translation that we have had for a year.  It is going to be a
close race to the finish line for both languages.  Then again,
the whole translation team is doing an amazing job.

As polarising as it may be, we have added HTTPS support in the
proxy server.  Another noteworthy item is StrongSwan 5.4.0, which
helps to address IPSec status page hangs that some have observed
with complex setups.  We are looking for feedback for these items,
please do write in.

Here are the full patch notes:

o src: tzdata updated to 2016c[1]
o src: prevent kernel panic on ipfw/dummynet module unload
o src: let ng_ether_attach() only attach to supported types to
  avoid kernel panics

  pcre 8.38 (patched CVE-2016-1283)[4], php 5.6.20[5]

  (contributed by Smart-Soft Ltd.)
