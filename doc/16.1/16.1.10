Hi everyone,

It has been a quite uneventful week.  Suricata and Squid have been
upgraded to their latest versions and you can find their individual
change logs below.  The next part of the Russian translation brings
it to number one with a dreamy 83% completed.  Otherwise only small
fixes and improvements have been made and those will not even require
a reboot.

Here is the full list of changes:

o ports: suricata 3.0.1[1], squid 3.5.16[2]
o traffic shaper: added individual tabs to quick navigation
o traffic shaper: fix behaviour on pppoe devices
o openvpn: revive windows installer binaries
o firewall: validate alias url download
o system: improved config history and backup pages layout
o system: increased backup count default from 30 to 60
o system: moved several settings to different pages for better
  technology alignment
o system: /var /tmp MFS awareness for crash dumps added
o trust: add "IP security IKE intermediate" to server key usage
o firmware: moved reboot, halt and defaults pages to new home
o proxy: add redirection rule creation link for HTTPS proxy
  (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o pptp: prevent service from printing boot messages due to a
  stale entry in the default config.xml
o interfaces: show LAGG protocol in overview page
o languages: another large batch of Russian, now 83% complete
  (contributed by Smart-Soft Ltd.)
o languages: updated French, German and Japanese

Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
