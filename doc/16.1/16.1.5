Dear friends and followers,

It pleases us to say that although we ship the latest OpenSSL 1.0.2g today,
we have had both SSv2 and SSv3 support disabled in our installation for a
long while, so older installations are also not affected by yesterday's
announcement.  On a slightly related note, LibreSSL was not affected at all.

With that out of the way, we also happily let you know that we are shipping
RFC 4638 support with this stable release.  We also push a fix for an
upstream bug in Unbound and update Squid to the latest version... again. ;)

We have also announced the roadmap for 16.7.  Take a look at our upcoming
milestones:

And now, here are the full patch notes:

o ports: squid 3.5.15[1], unbound 1.5.7 hotfix[2], pkg 1.6.4 hotfix[3],
  openssl 1.0.2g[4]
o services: infrastructure rework for plugin additions
o openvpn: added copy/move to client-specific overrides
o openvpn: allow binding client-specific overrides to specific server(s)
o openvpn: service on/off toggle via overview pages
o openvpn: fix problem with service status display
o openvpn: when services are disabled, make sure a reconfigure will always
  stop the associated process
o vpn: transform PPTP, L2TP and PPPoE servers to plugin addition to be
  removed from base install for 16.7
o vpn: add proper service probing for PPTP, L2TP and PPPoE servers
o interfaces: added RFC 4638 support (MTU > 1492 in PPPoE)
o ntp: disable when no servers are set
o language: updates for Chinese, French and German


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
