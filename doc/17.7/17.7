Hello, hello!

For more than two and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We are writing to you today to announce the final release of version
17.7 "Free Fox", which, over the course of the last 6 months, includes
highlights such as SafeStack application hardening, the Realtek re(4)
driver for better network stability, a Quagga plugin with broad routing
protocol support and the Unbound resolver as the new default.  Additionally,
translations for Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and German have been
completed for the first time during this development cycle.

Focus in OPNsense has shifted to improving and streamlining its various
systems and providing continuous updates, which amounts to over 300
individual changes made since 17.1 so far.  The plugin infrastructure is
growing as well thanks to our awesome contributors Frank Wall, Frank
Brendel, Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz.  And we, last but not least,
have been working more closely than ever with HardenedBSD by unifying
our ports infrastructure.
