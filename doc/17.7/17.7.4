Dear all,

Another week, another update.  Most notably, the Tor plugin has been
officially released.

New images finally follow in 17.7.5 and we are happy to report that
the shared forwarding additions are already up and running on the
FreeBSD 11.1 kernel with two major improvements: IPv6 support and
tryforward compatibility!  That means 18.1-BETA and an associated
public call for testing are not too far out at this point.

And here are the full patch notes:

o system: remove revoked certificates from list of certificates to revoke
o firewall: add advanced setting to disable interface gateway rules
o firewall: ignore gateway weight of zero
o firewall: add reply-to specific gateway in pluggable rules
o firewall: support anchor quick keyword in pluggable rules
o intrusion detection: do not allow interface group in selection
o openvpn: ns-cert-type becomes remote-cert-tls in client export
o web proxy: ICAP exclude list (contributed by Alexander Shursha)
o mvc: support value attribute for model option data
o installer: UEFI partition size increased to 200 MB
o installer: always error on password mismatch
o plugins: os-acme-client 1.11 (contributed by Frank Wall)
o plugins: os-c-icap 1.1 logging and virus scan settings (contributed
  by Michael Muenz)
o plugins: os-tor 1.0 (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o plugins: os-zerotier 1.2.0 allows local.conf settings (contributed
  by David Harrigan)
o ports: libnghttp2 1.26[2]
o ports: unbound 1.6.6[3]
o ports: hyperscan 4.5.2[4]
o ports: py-openssl 17.3.0[5]
o ports: py-cryptography 2.03[6]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
