A good day everyone!

Sorry about the delay while we chased a race condition in the updates back
to an issue with the latest FreeBSD package manager updates.  For now we
reverted to our current version but all relevant third party packages have
been updated as updates became available over the last weeks, e.g. cURL and
Python, and hostapd / wpa_supplicant amongst others.
