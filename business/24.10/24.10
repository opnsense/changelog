Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o The dashboard has been replaced. Widgets from the old format are no longer supported and need to be rewritten by the respective authors.
o ISC DHCP will no longer reload DNS services on static mapping edits. This is for feature parity with Kea DHCP and avoiding cross-service complications. If you expect your static mappings to show up in a particular DNS service please restart this service manually.
