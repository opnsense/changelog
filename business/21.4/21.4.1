This business release is based on the OPNsense 21.1.5 community version
with additional reliability improvements.

The OpenVPN advisory tracked as CVE-2020-15078 does not affect the provided
version 2.4.11, but the security audit will falsely flag it as vulnerable
because the source of the audit is FreeBSD where OpenVPN was migrated to 2.5
series already.
