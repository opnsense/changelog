Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o The Unbound ACL now defaults to accept all traffic and no longer generates automatic entries.  This was done to avoid connectivity issues on dynamic address setups -- especially with VPN interfaces.  If this is undesirable you can set it to default to block instead and add your manual entries to pass.
o Dpinger no longer triggers alarms on its own as its mechanism is too simplistic for loss and delay detection as provided by apinger a long time ago.  Delay and loss triggers have been fixed and logging was improved.  The rc.syshook facility "monitor" still exists but is only provided for compatibility reasons with existing user scripts.
o IPsec "tunnel settings" GUI is now deprecated and manual migration to the "connections" GUI is possible.  There are currently no plans to remove the deprecated legacy component so it can be used without restriction.
o The new OpenVPN instances pages and API create an independent set of instances more closely following the upstream documentation of OpenVPN. Legacy client/server settings cannot be managed from the API and are not migrated, but will continue to work independently.
o The old DynDNS plugin was removed in favor of the newer MVC/API plugin for ddclient.  Ddclient used to be EoL for a few months this year but currently a new release is being prepared.  We have since maintained a copy of the software and fixed bugs and shipped upstream patches as they became available in the development version.  Also, a native Python backend is available in the same plugin which covers the Dyndns2 protocol, AWS Route 53, Azure, Cloudflare and DuckDNS.
