Hello there,

As 18.1 is drawing near this stable update for the 17.7 series could be
the last one.  So whether there will be a hotfix to enable the update path
or a full 17.7.13 remains to be seen, but we will keep you informed either
way.  The targeted release date for 18.1 is January 29.

For now we refrain from letting users upgrade directly to the release
candidates, but suffice to say that with the development version
accompanying this update it is possible from the console.  And again
thank you to all early adopters which have made the release candidates
a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
