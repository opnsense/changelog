Hi everyone,

Our first stable round of version 17.7 brings a number of improvements,
fixes and software updates for third party services.  Special attention
goes to the major bump of LibreSSL from 2.4 to 2.5.  NAT before IPsec is
now also neatly integrated and there are new plugins for fast Collectd
and Zerotier setup.

We would also like to use this opportunity to remind everyone that
OPNsense is and always will be free software.  All of its source
code and associated build tools can be found here:

Over the course of the coming weeks, we will be focusing on releasing the
roadmap for version 18.1, ClamAV integration, PHP 7.1 and going back to
a more frequent update schedule.
