Hi there,

We pop in for a short stable update, namely 16.1.4.  Squid has been
updated to 3.5.14 and received a GUI entry for maximum_object_size
to define since the default has been reported as a wee bit too small.

In other news, the final roadmap for 16.7 will be unveiled later this
week after much internal discussion.  Our main goals are to finish a
full code audit, further alignment with FreeBSD and a few tiny
surprises.  Stay tuned for those.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

o ports: squid 3.5.14[1]
o dhcp: fix menu expand with IPv6 configuration
o captive portal: fix database timeout lock message
o interfaces: fix expand/collapse on status page for Edge
o proxy: add maximum_object_size setting for squid
o load balancer: improve filter reload to prevent traffic lockout (contributed by Frank Wall)
o layout: fix searchable dropdown truncation with IE
o firewall: fix action buttons on alias edit
o menu: updated help menu entries


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
