Good news everyone,

It is time for a smaller update to 16.1.3.  There is another fix for our
Hyper-V users, the health section finally received its CPU temperature
graph and a few ports have been updated to their latest version.  Nothing
of particular interest happened, no issues with glibc from our side today.  :)

A number of assorted issues have been flushed from the code thanks to good
use of the crash reporter.  A special thank you goes to those of you who
submit email addresses and a brief description along with the report.  For
us it is tremendously useful to get as many details as possible and to
verify that our fixed work reliably in a particular use cases before
shipping them.

Enough with the announcing already, here are the full patch notes:
