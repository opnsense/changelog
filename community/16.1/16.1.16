Dear all,

It has been a long journey for HardenedBSD and OPNsense, and
finally the paths start to merge as the splendid and battle-
proven ASLR implementation gets incorporated into the default
installation!  It is just the beginning as we will start to
leverage the extra security by enabling position independent
execution in 16.7 and merge more security-related features.
We thank again the HardenedBSD team for their continued efforts
on making this world a safer place.

In other news, there is a thoroughly revamped dashboard for you
to enjoy and a handful of security fixes in FreeBSD and the ports
ecosystem.  LibreSSL has been updated to the latest production
release and the BETA version is progressing nicely as we change
our working mode from "rework all the things" to "polish all the
things".  A release candidate is coming up soon.

Here are the patch notes for 16.1.16:
