Hello there,

It is time for something new.  How about an update with your new NetFlow
remote export.  Or your local reporting frontend?  Well, you can always
use both if you like.  Read all about it here:

https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/netflow.html

Furthermore, we have added the brand new AQM CoDel version 0.2.1 to the
mix, yesterday's FreeBSD security advisories, released the HAProxy plugin,
bundled a full Japanese translation.  And two-factor authentication support
for our components?  Yes, we also have that now.  :)

There is also a refreshed website for our general viewing pleasure.  Let
us know what you think or what it is missing.
