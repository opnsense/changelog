Hello there,

This quick 16.1.8 is not a big update, but it means a lot.  We have
finished our full sweep of the GUI to update the look and feel of all
pages and made the code ready for what is to come now: new features
that are on our roadmap for 16.7.  The first one will be the HTTPS
proxy, but there is also NetFlow and improved statistics / reporting
on the shortlist.

A day after 16.1.7 was out last week, FreeBSD 10.2-RELEASE-p14 was
announced.  Of the four patches enclosed, the two Hyper-V patches we
have already brought to OPNsense over a month ago, the OpenSSH patch
does not apply since we only use the port and already had it up-to-date.
That leaves us with only one patch that we are shipping now to complete
the experience.

Attention to everyone using OpenVPN + cryptodev acceleration: the
cryptodev module along with older crypto drivers has been removed
from the kernel itself, which means that if you need to keep using
it, go to System: Settings: Misc and reconfigure your crypto hardware
including an enable of cryptodev usage.

The refreshed images for 16.1 (based on 16.1.8) have been pushed to
the mirrors.  You can find the checksums attached at the end of this
announcement.
