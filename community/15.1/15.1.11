Hello everyone,

As we are nearing the finish line for version 15.7 in July, we sat down on
a single table in the Netherlands this week to review the changes that we've
made over the past 5 months and we saw that only one road map[1] item is
still open: the frequently requested IDS package!  We've come a long way
since the initial 15.1 and have seen stability increase, functionality
expand and timely updates being sustained on an almost weekly basis.
Certainly achievements we want to keep whilst going forward.

The initial release of 15.1.11 has been postponed since Tuesday due to a
framework update we've had to exclude as well as polishing the new GUI
firmware feature to finally revive the base system update.  If you are
updating from the GUI to this release, you will still have to run the
Console Firmware (Option 12) upgrade to bring your base system up to date
(FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE-p10).  This is the last time, we promise.  A reboot
is mandatory.

We ship PHP 5.6.9 ahead of FreeBSD, removed numerous unused packages and
two more custom kernel patches bringing us down to 5 custom patches from
previously more than 40.  We also have plans for further pruning, probably
running without custom patches when FreeBSD 10.2 hits the shelves,
metaphorically speaking.

We haven't forgotten the recent Logjam Attack[2], but wanted not to postpone
the current release any further.  With that being said, 15.1.11.1 is coming
out tomorrow including wary tweaks related to Logjam.

Here is the full list of changes for 15.1.11:

o core: removed unused package dependencies b42-fwcutter, bwi-firmware-kmod, dmidecode, ifstated, pecl-ssh2
o core: switched back from bind-tools to the latest full bind 9.10 package due to various requests
o src: fix panic in pf(4) in conjunction with ALTQ[3]
o src: updated to FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE-p10[4][5]
o src: reverted two more custom patches to align with FreeBSD
o ports: updated to ca_root_nss 3.19, sqlite 3.8.10.1, php 5.6.9[6], openssh 6.8p1_7[7]
o opnsense-update: exclude /etc/tty from the upgrade
o bsdinstaller: reworked the internals to align to modern port standards
o captive portal: switched rules generation to new template engine
o firmware: reimplement the GUI firmware update using MVC code
o menu: remove collapse/expand inconsistencies
o dashboard: fix disabled widgets dialog
o nat: fixed delete of multiple item
o nat: fix display of disabled rules
o queues: the legacy ALTQ traffic shaper is now found under "Firewall: Queues" to make room for the upcoming traffic shaper reimplementation based on IPFW/dummynet
o core: fix faulty read of /var/log/dmesg.boot

The live upgrades are up for both LibreSSL and OpenSSL.  Images will follow
in a later announcement as the testing backlog has gotten larger with more
images and flavours.  We are working on a Continuous Integration platform,
but for now we're still doing things manually.


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
