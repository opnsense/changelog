Dear fellow firewall enthusiasts,

Today's update includes a shiny new rewrite of the traffic shaper
functionality for dummynet, another completed chapter in the ongoing
quest for standardisation towards FreeBSD.  The other gem is the first
batch of translations for Simplified Chinese kindly provided by two of
our enthusiastic users from China.  We ask for you to try both features
and let us know about limitations and issues through any of the usual
channels.  We appreciate likes and don't-likes alike.  :)

Security-wise, it has been rather quiet.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Here
are the full patch notes:

o notable ports upgrades: pcre 8.37, pkg 1.5.3, ca_root_nss 3.19.1
o aliases: fix javascript error that prevented aliases from woking
o traffic shaper: rewrote the feature using standard components on top of the new MVC framework/API (see Firewall: Traffic Shaper)
o system: enabled first few hundred translations of Simplified Chinese to help the community to progress and review said translation (see System: Settings: General)
o vpn: all GUI files underwent a thorough coding style refresh
o firmware: prevent spurious "Module already loaded" errors while upgrading PHP packages

The packages for OpenSSL and LibreSSL are up and can be applied via the
GUI or console firmware upgrade.


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
