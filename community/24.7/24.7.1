A good day to you all,

This release includes a batch of dashboard changes due to the reliable
feedback we have received from you all so far.  There will be more dashboard
changes in the future mostly relating to UX and sane default behaviour
so just know we are aware.

A few smaller regressions due to the Phalcon module replacement efforts
have been fixed as well.  IPv6 behaviour has been adjusted for SLAAC and
the web GUI.

Last but not least we found and fixed a number of issues with FreeBSD 14.1
and are including its security advisories from yesterday while at it.

MVC/API conversions are already being carried out in the development version
and it seems that PPP-related connectivity will get a bigger makeover too.
The roadmap for 25.1 will be discussed and likely published later this month.
