Hi there,

This ships a number of base system changes, kernel fixes and driver
updates.  The time-loop authentication change is back with the fixed
TOTP case and the Unbound domain overrides are now found in query
forwarding since this offers the same functionality anyway.

With the year almost over we are shifting focus to finishing the items
on the roadmap and it is nice to note that the MVC/API conversions are
already over 75% complete.  That means it will not take another decade
to migrate the other 25%.  ;)

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: readd a "time-loop" around authentication for failed attempts
o system: remove the SSL bundles in default locations
o system: prevent JS crashing out when dashboard widget title is not set
o system: use system instead of sample defaults when reverting tunables
o system: report actual LAN address being used after factory reset
o interfaces: use Autoconf class to avoid raw ifctl file access
o interfaces: remove ancient MAC address trickery to unbreak hostapd
o interfaces: add missing neighbor and DNS lookup page ACL entries
o interfaces: PPP device page ACL missed getserviceproviders.php
o firmware: force CRL check on development deployment
o firmware: use REQUEST to print a TLS/CRL usage hint
o firmware: improved output helpers and associated cleanup in audit scripts
o firmware: opnsense-update: add support for regression tests set
o intrusion detection: limit stats.log logging (contributed by doktornotor)
o kea-dhcp: add dhcp-socket-type option (contributed by Till Niederauer)
o kea-dhcp: add MAC formatter to leases page (contributed by cpalv)
o openvpn: support case-insensitive strict user CN matching for instances
o unbound: move domain overrides to query forwarding
o mvc: let JsonKeyValueStoreField cache configd call for the duration of the session
o mvc: another batch of sessionClose() cleanups in controllers
o mvc: cleanup in ApiMutableServiceControllerBase
o mvc: fix hint display for "0"
