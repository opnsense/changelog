Dear all,

Today we are switching pf stateful tracking of ICMPv6 neighbour discoveries
off in order to fix the previous instability with the FreeBSD security
advisory first shipped in 24.7.1.  We do this in order to provide the same
reliable IPv6 functionality that was on all previous versions prior to
24.7.1 at the cost of resurfacing CVE-2024-6640 until a better solution
has been devised.  A link to the long and difficult upstream bug report is
included below.

But that is not all.  The GUI gains snapshot support on ZFS installations by
implementing what is called "boot environments" which allows one to move
seamlessly from one snapshot to another via reboot.  This functionality can
also be accessed from the boot loader menu option "8" for a quick recovery
ensuring that at least one other snapshot was created to boot into.  A very
special thank you to Sheridan Computers for contributing this feature.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add snapshots (boot environments) support via MVC/API (contributed by Sheridan Computers)
o system: remove obsolete dashboard sync
o system: compact services widget on dashboard
o system: convert lock mode to edit mode on dashboard
o system: link certificates by subject on import
o system: unify how log search clauses work and add a search time constraint
o system: move to static imports for widget base classes on dashboard
o system: fix ACL check on dashboard restore and add safety check for save action
o system: change dashboard modify buttons to a bootstrap group (contributed by Jaka Prašnikar)
o interfaces: add "newwanip_map" event and deprecate old "newwanip" one
o interfaces: keep 24.7 backwards compatibility by allowing 6RD and 6to4 on PPP
o interfaces: add logging to PPP link scripts to check for overlap
o interfaces: return correct uppercase interface name in getArp()
o interfaces: fix issue with PPP port not being posted
o dhcrelay: start on "newwanip_map" event as well
o intrusion detection: update the default suricata.yaml (contributed by Jim McKibben)
o ipsec: move two logging settings to correct location misplaced in previous version
o ipsec: fix migration and regression during handling of "disablevpnrules" setting
o wireguard: support CARP VHID reuse on different interfaces
o mvc: when a hint is provided, also show them for selectpickers
o rc: fix banner HTTPS fingerprint
o plugins: os-ddclient 1.24[1]
