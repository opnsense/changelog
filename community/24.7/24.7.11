A happy holiday season to you all,

This is a minor update all things considered, but it does bring you
the long sought after Tailscale plugin courtesy of Sheridan Computers.
Suricata is also updated to its latest version to fix a couple of CVEs.

In other news, 25.1 will contain FreeBSD 14.2 which will be available
for BETA preview using images later this week as well.  The 25.1-BETA
will also include a rewritten theme (light and dark) using the new
OPNsense logo already being used in the documentation.  It also has
MVC/API support for the user and group management plus more you can
always find on the roadmap[1] in detail.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: show multiple SAN entries when supplied by the certificate
o system: traffic dashboard widget should persist interface identifiers
o system: reset dashboard widget options to the default if none of the options match
o system: mismatch in returned "change" attribute for route toggle
