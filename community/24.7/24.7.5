A good day to you all,

This release removes significant processing overhead from larger setups
due to being able to coalesce parallel configuration requests for the same
component instead of iterating over the list of selected interfaces one
by one.  A number of third party software updates and FreeBSD security
advisories are included as well.

This update also disables NUMA by default which can bring a boost in
network throughput on affected systems.  And of course we are still
working on dashboard improvements so now the treasured picture widget
is back with a better integration approach.

Also take note that the NTP default changes to "restrict noquery" so that
the system cannot externally be queried for revealing system internals
anymore unless explicitly allowed.

The technical stuff out of the way we would simply like to add that we
had a great time at EuroBSDCon in Dublin over the weekend.  Lots of good
and productive conversations.  Looking forward to more of those!  :)
