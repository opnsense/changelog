Hello,

For more than 9 and a half years now, OPNsense is driving innovation
through modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.7, nicknamed "Thriving Tiger", features a new dashboard, system trust
MVC/API support, GRE and GIF MVC/API support, NAT 1-to-1 MVC/API support,
WireGuard QR code generator, dynamic IPsec VTI tunnel support, experimental
OpenVPN DCO support, FreeBSD 14.1, Python 3.11 plus much more.

The upgrade path from 24.1.x will follow tomorrow.  Do not be hasty.
The major operating system upgrade has not happened in while and should
be taken with the appropriate amount of care.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o The dashboard has been replaced. Widgets from the old format are no longer supported and need to be rewritten by the respective authors.
o ISC DHCP will no longer reload DNS services on static mapping edits. This is for feature parity with Kea DHCP and avoiding cross-service complications. If you expect your static mappings to show up in a DNS service please restart it manually.
