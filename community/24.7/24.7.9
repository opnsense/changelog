Dear all,

This is a minor update that further tweaks the trust store integration
and firmware updates tying into it although in practice it does not
change the current behaviour from a user perspective.  If something is
not behaving as usual afterwards please let us know.

A new plugin has been added to finally allow proxying ND messages for
those people stuck on a single /64 prefix delegation.  Otherwise it
has been pretty quiet as you can see.  But we will be back soon.  ;)

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: revert CRLs in bundles as the default bundles will be removed in 25.1
o system: migrate authoritative bundle location to /usr/local/etc/ssl/cert.pem
o system: flush the global OpenSSL configuration to /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf as well
o system: ignore gateway monitor status on boot when setting up routes
o system: fix IP address validation not being displayed in the gateway form
o system: add a "time-loop" around authentication for failed attempts
o reporting: ISO dates and logical ranges in health graphs (contributed by Roy Orbitson)
o interfaces: kill defunct route-to states with the stale gateway IP
o firewall: make loopback traffic stateful again to fix its use with syncookie option
o firewall: add 'Action' property to list of retrieved rules
o firewall: use UUIDs as rule labels to ease tracking
o firmware: refactor for generic config.sh use and related code audit
o firmware: move the bogons update script to the firmware scripts, improve logging messages and use config.sh
o firmware: opnsense-version: restored pre-2019 default output format (contributed by TotalGriffLock)
o openvpn: add Require Client Provisioning option for instances
o backend: add 'configd environment' debug action
o mvc: always do stop/start on forced restart
o mvc: remove obsolete sessionClose() use in Base, Firmware, Unbound and WireGuard controllers
o plugins: os-debug 1.6
o plugins: os-ndproxy 1.0 adds an IPv6 Neighbour Discovery proxy
o plugins: os-wazuh-agent 1.2[1]
o ports: py-duckdb 1.1.3[2]

A hotfix release was issued as 24.7.9_1:

o system: reverted "time-loop" patch as it makes Local+TOTP authentication fail


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
