Hi all,

It has been 5 months since 16.1 came out.  Since then, over 1500 commits
and 18 stable releases have continuously improved and enhanced the
project.  Since then, thousands of new users have joined.  And, since
then, our new documentation has been extended and tweaked with numerous
guides, explanations and answers to your questions.

The cumulation of these efforts is this announcement of the first release
candidate for 16.7.  Images are being provided to encourage to try these
in a fresh setting, but the config import in the installer and the GUI
work as usual so that migration is simple.  Checksums for the images can
be found below.  VGA images have been omitted to permit work on the UEFI
variant in the meantime.

The RC cycle will end in a month with the actual 16.7 release so that
early birds will not have to reinstall afterwards.  Remember: feedback
is key in this phase, feel free to contact us in any way you like and
let us make 16.7 grand together.
