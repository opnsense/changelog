Hi everyone,

We bring to your attention this update with a batch of enhancements
and the occasional bugfix intertwined.  It is interesting to note that
the enhancements vs. bugfix ratio is as high as 5:1.  :)

Brand new is the general availability of the Italian translation thanks
to the work of Antonio Prado.  The work is still ongoing and all help is
highly appreciated.  Also, the web font has been updated to enhance
display of Cyrillic letters.  We just love fostering the translations!
