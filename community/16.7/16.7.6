Hi all,

This update is preparation for the upcoming major release firmware
upgrades, because FreeBSD 11.0 just came out (yay!).  The intended
target for this version is OPNsense 17.1, so it feels only natural
to add the bits and bolts for it as early as possible.  Seamless
upgrades from any major release to the next is our mission.  :)

A few security-related ports got updated to their latest versions
and we have fixed the PSK-related IPsec regression that sneaked
into 16.7.5.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add language selection to initial wizard
o system: allow disabling the root user
o firmware: new mirror in Serbia[1] (contributed by FourDots)
o firmware: assorted changes for upcoming major upgrade
o interfaces: wait for DHCP6 client to properly exit
o firewall: allow route-to to loopback gateways
o openvpn: fix download of config file for iOS
o ipsec: fix mobile / PSK regression of 16.7.5
o intrusion detection: added syslog support
o dns: improve forwarder interface listening generation
o rc: silence backup warnings about stripped leading slashes
o ports: bind 9.10.4-P3[2]
o ports: ca_root_nss 3.27.1[3]
o ports: libressl 2.3.8[4]
o ports: unbound 1.5.10[5]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
