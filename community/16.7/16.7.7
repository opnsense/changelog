Hi everyone,

This update brings several reliability and security improvements
as usual.  Our LibreSSL fans will notice the version 2.3 has finally
been replaced with 2.4 and we switched to position independent
executables in our base system to make good use of HardenedBSD ASLR.

Another hot topic is the addition of a Czech translation into the
release.  Many thanks to pavelb for making that happen!

Overall progress towards OPNsense 17.1 is steady: native PAM support
is through the testing phase and major FreeBSD upgrade support is
already enclosed within this very update.  Our next step is the release
of beta images some time during November.

Here are the full patch notes:

o captive portal: add expire voucher option
o intrusion detection: added support for compressed rule files
o web proxy: basic auth support for remote ACLs
o web proxy: fix ICAP config write for MIME-types (contributed by
  Fabian Franz)
o ipsec: fix spacing and type for shared secrets on Windows 7+
o ipsec: restart must only restart, not completely reconfigure
o ipsec: correctly set 28673 option to "yes"
o openvpn: reintroduce zip usage instead of 7z
o interfaces: fix performance issues on status page
o interfaces: fix ARP and NDP to show all entries
o rc: revamp the handling of /boot/loader.conf to be fully pluggable

o ports: php 5.6.27[3]
