Hi all,

The builds for 17.1-BETA are rolling as we write this and we are mighty
proud of having come so far!  Almost two years ago we started with a
simple vision and have been staying true to our goal of providing stable
licensing, swift updates and modern features.  But that story is not
for today.  :)

In the meantime, this 16.7.11 update receives newer versions of OpenVPN
and Suricata, improved password hashing and two DNS forwarder fixes.
Furthermore, the firmware feature received an extensive user experience
boost, including, but not limited to, being able to read pending release
notes.

Here is the full list of changes:

o system: improved password hashing[1] (contributed by OSNet)
