Hi all,

We are back for one last update of the 16.7 series with a small number
of fixes and security-related package updates.  Do not forget that 17.1
is scheduled for next week: the update instructions will be delivered via
the usual firmware update path.

Until then, here are the full patch notes:

o traffic shaper: order rules numerically by sequence number
o firmware: added opnsense-revert tool for release-based package revert
o captive portal: fix downloading files in Chrome
o insight: fix downloading files in Chrome
o mvc: consistently set locale (contributed by Alexander Shursha)
o mvc: do not deliver content twice on API calls
o python: downgraded to 2.7.12 in order to fix segmentation faults within insight reporting
o libressl: avoid possible side-channel leak of ECDSA private keys when signing[1]
o ports: bind 9.10.4-P5[2]
o ports: perl 5.24.1[3]
o ports: sqlite 3.16.2[4]
o ports: openssh 7.4p1[5]
o ports: sudo 1.8.19p2[6]
o ports: lighttpd 1.4.45[7]
o ports: php 5.6.30[8]

Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
