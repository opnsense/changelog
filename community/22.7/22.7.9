Hi!

A quick update to address the new FreeBSD security advisory for ping utility
as well as Suricata.  The DNS block list was rewritten in Python and there
will be a couple of cool additions for it in the foreseeable future.  :)

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: fix internal CRL check (contributed by kulikov-a)
o system: fix a few minor Coverty Scan reports[1]
o interfaces: use get_interface_list() to identify hardware devices
o interfaces: fix single ACL use for MVC/API interface pages
o firewall: add category selection to aliases
o unbound: rework DNSBL implementation to Python module
o backend: clean up scripts/systemheath location
o backend: moved log format definitions to new location for core and several plugins
o mvc: change default sorting to case-insensitive
o mvc: move JavaScript and CSS imports to base controller
o mvc: make sure HostnameField with ZoneRootAllowed accepts "@." prefix
o plugins: os-telegraf 1.12.7[2]
o plugins: os-theme-cicada 1.30 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-theme-vicuna 1.42 (contributed by Team Rebellion)
o plugins: os-wireguard now attempts to start tunnels again when all DNS is configured
o src: ixgbe: workaround errata about UDP frames with zero checksum
o src: hpet: Allow a MMIO window smaller than 1K
o src: ping: fix handling of IP packet sizes[3]
o ports: php 8.0.26[4]
o ports: sqlite 3.40.0[5]
o ports: suricata 6.0.9[6]

A hotfix release was issued as 22.7.9_3:

o unbound: fix blocklist use with DNS64 mode (contributed by kulikov-a)
o unbound: change working directory before checking configuration
o web proxy: fix broken " Google GSuite restricted" option
o ports: suricata backs out new V14 netmap API changes for now[7]
