Hello there,

This ships OpenSSL and Python security updates as well as address a number
of shortcomings of the initial 26.1 and community-infused improvements of
the new rules GUI which we would not have dreamed of to get this quickly.

We are very happy with the current state of the new rules GUI and all the
discussions we have had on how it can be further improved.  It is just the
beginning.  A roadmap for 26.7 will be in the works later this month.

Looking back 11 years it appears that the best hopes we had for the project
back then have all come true.  It took lot longer than expected but we
got there together with you, our beloved community.  It will only take
a bit more work now to achieve MVC/API support for all core components and
remove root access from the web GUI.  And we hope that you will be up for
it in the coming years as well.

Images will likely be reissued based on this release, but it is not an
immediate priority.  Upgrade paths from 25.7 will also be updated in the
near future to ensure the best possible upgrade experience.
