Hi there,

For over 11 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates, modern IPv6 support, as well as clear
and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

26.1, nicknamed "Witty Woodpecker", features almost a full firewall
MVC/API experience as automation rules have been promoted to the new
rules GUI, Suricata version 8 with inline inspection mode using "divert",
assorted IPv6 reliability and feature improvements, router advertisements
MVC/API, full code shell command escaping revamp, default IPv6
mode now using Dnsmsaq for client connectivity, Unbound blocklist source
selection, an automatic host discovery service, plus much more.

The upgrade path for 25.7 will likely be unlocked on January 29, which
is probably tomorrow if anyone is asking why it is not there yet.
We want to ensure the upgrade goes as smoothly as possible so please
be patient!  :)

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o ISC-DHCP moves to a plugin. It will be automatically installed during upgrades. It is not installed on new installations because it is not being used, but you can still install and keep using it.
o To accommodate the change away from ISC-DCHP defaults the "Track interface" IPv6 mode now has a sibling called "Identity Association" which does the same except it is not automatically starting ISC-DHCPv6 and Radvd router advertisements to allow better interoperability with Kea and Dnsmasq setups.
o Dnsmasq is now the default for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 as well as RA out of the box.  One thing that the upstream software cannot cover is prefix delegation so that is no longer offered by default.  Use another DHCPv6 server in this case.
o Due to command line execution safety concerns the historic functions mwexec_bg() and mwexec() will be removed in 26.1.x.  Make sure your custom code is not using them and use mwexecf(), mwexecfb() and mwexecfm() instead.
o The function sessionClose() has also been removed from the MVC code and is no longer needed.  Make sure to remove it from your custom code.
o The custom.yaml support has been removed from intrusion detection.  Please migrate to the newer /usr/local/etc/suricata/conf.d override directory.
o The new host discovery service "hostwatch" is enabled by default (since 25.7.11).  You can always turn it off under Interfaces: Neighbors: Automatic Discovery if you so choose.
o The firewall migration page is not something you need to jump into right away.  Please make yourself familiar with the new rules GUI first and check the documentation for incompatibilities.  Single interface from the floating interface will not be considered "floating" in priorities.
o Firewall: NAT: Port Forwarding is now called "Destination NAT".  Firewall rule associations are no longer supported, but the old associated firewall rules remain in place with their last known configuration and can now be edited to suit future needs.
o Firewall: NAT: Source NAT is from the set of pages formerly known as automation, but One to One NAT is still the main page for these types of rules.
