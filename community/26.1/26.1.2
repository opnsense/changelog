Hi there,

This is a smallish update with a number of fixes and another round of Python
CVEs addressed.  New images based on this stable version are planned for next
week.

At the moment work focuses on the IPv6 support for the captive portal which
should not be too far away now.  The 26.7 roadmap will also be published at
the end of this month.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: remove "upstream" from gateway grid as priority already reflects the proper data
o system: adjust gateway group priority (tier) wording
o interfaces: fix wlanmode argument usage
o firewall: fix target mapping inconsistency leading to references not being processed in destination NAT
o firewall: use local-port as target when specified in destination NAT
o firewall: fix missing reply-to when not specifically set in new rules
o firewall: live view: fix parsing of combined filters stored as converted strings
o firewall: fix group rename in source_net, destination_net and SNAT/DNAT target fields
o firewall: add tcpflags_any in new rules GUI for parity with legacy rules
o firewall: exclude loopback from interface selectpicker in new rules GUI
o firewall: well known ports added to filter rule selection
o firewall: undefined is also "*" in new rules grid
o firewall: add download button for validation errors in rule import
o firewall: allow TTL usage on host entries
o firmware: avoid update-hook background cleanups
o firmware: revoke 25.7 fingerprint
o kea: fix subnets GUI missing root node
o radvd: change tabs to spaces in radvd.conf for better maintenance
o unbound: safeguard the blocklist tester against empty configuration testing
o mvc: add $separator as parameter for CSV export and switch the default to a semicolon
o mvc: InterfaceField: minor adjustments and add resetStaticOptionList()
o mvc: catch empty data in CSV import
o tests: Shell: add testing framework
o plugins: os-haproxy 5.0[1]
o ports: expat 2.7.4[2]
o ports: hostwatch 1.0.12 now rate-limits database writes for recently seen hosts
o ports: ldns 1.9.0[3]
o ports: nss 3.120[4]
o ports: openldap 2.6.12[5]
o ports: openvpn 2.6.19[6]
o ports: py-duckdb 1.4.4[7]
o ports: python additional security fixes[8][9]

A hotfix release was issued as 26.1.2_5:

o firewall: add missing implementation for "disablereplyto" in new rules
o firewall: fix encoding issue in dashboard widget
o captive portal: fix hard-timeout calculation
o kea: add required scope to prefix watcher link local address route
o backend: allow non-intrusive config_read_array() and fix a gateway group delete issue with it
