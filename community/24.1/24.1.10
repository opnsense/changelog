Hi,

Today a number of security advisories in third party software are being
addressed.  Also, a bad dhcp6c patch has been reverted which requires
a manual reboot to take full effect.

CAUTION: The OpenSSH update prevents SSH sessions from being established.
You need to restart OpenSSH from the GUI or run the console command
"pluginctl -s openssh restart" or reboot the system in order to unbreak it.

Here are the full patch notes:

o interfaces: support reading more attributes in ifconfig output parser
o interfaces: correct logic of resolve flag in ARP table (contributed by Kevin Pelzel)
