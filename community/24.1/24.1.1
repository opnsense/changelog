Hello,

Apart from rolling back Suricata 7 to 6 the new major version is looking good.
The two intertwined Suricata default config changes in version 7 have been
identified and fixed in the development version so that we can move back to
version 7 in 24.1.2.

This minor release is intended as a small round of fixes and third party
updates to ensure reliability and security.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: enable OpenSSL legacy provider by default to allow Google Drive backup to continue working with OpenSSL 3
o system: bring back the interface statistics dashboard widget update interval
o system: fix all items in the OPNsense container being synced in XMLRCP when NAT option is selected
o interfaces: overview page UX improvements
o firewall: align GeoIP file check with documentation
o firewall: fix virtual IP API use with subnet/subnet_bits usage
o wireguard: allow instances to start their ID at 0 like they used to a long time ago
o dhcp: omit faulty comma in Kea config when control agent is disabled
o dhcp: add opt-out automatic firewall rules for Kea server access
o ipsec: remove AEAD algorithms without a PRF for IKE proposals in connections
o openvpn: fix cso_login_matching being ignored during authentication
o backend: optimise stream_handler to exit and kill running process when no listener is attached
o plugins: os-frr 1.39[1]
o plugins: os-haproxy 4.3[2]
o plugins: os-ntopng 1.3[3]
o plugins: os-tor 1.10 adds MyFamily support (contributed by Mike Bishop)
o ports: nss 3.97[4]
o ports: openldap 2.6.7[5]
o ports: openssl 3.0.13[6]
o ports: syslog-ng 4.6.0[7]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
