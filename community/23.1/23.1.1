Hello,

Apart from security updates for operating system and third party software
this mainly fixes issues with the initial 23.1 release.  IPsec and Unbound
components in particular receive a number of improvements being the more
prominent areas of work for this series.  Unbound also gained a SafeSearch
option and the new reporting database CPU usage should be much lower and
easier to use.

Overall we are happy with how the major release turned out and look forward
to further fixes in e.g. Netmap framework including Suricata changes for
multi-threading support which has been in the works for a long time.  OpenVPN
2.6 update and related changes are also pending at the moment.

The roadmap for 23.7 will be published soon and will again include a number
of MVC/API conversions for static components.  Statistics do indicate that we
are over 60% done with converting the code base to a modern framework as
compared to early 2015 which is now already over 8 years ago!

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: replace single exec_command() with new shell_safe() wrapper

o firewall: do not switch gateway on bootup
o captive portal: enforce a database repair during operation if necessary
o firmware: move single-call function to reporter page
o intrusion detection: properly reset metadata response when no metadata is found
o ipsec: allow "@" character in eap_id fields for new connections
o ipsec: missing remapping pool UUID to name for new connections

o ipsec: fix username parsing in lease status
o ipsec: refactor widget to use new data format

o unbound: drop unnecessary index from reporting database and other optimizations to lower CPU usage
o unbound: add HTTPS record type to reporting
o unbound: remember reporting page logarithmic setting
o unbound: missing global so that cache is never flushed when requested
o mvc: cleanse $record input in searchRecordsetBase() before usage
o plugins: os-haproxy 4.1[1]

o src: import tzdata 2022g[7]
o src: ipsec: clear pad bytes in PF_KEY messages
o src: fib_algo: set vnet when destroying algo instance

o src: pfctl: rule.label is a two-dimensional array
o src: pf: fix syncookies in conjunction with tcp fast port reuse
o src: pf: fix panic on deferred packets
o src: ipfw: add missing 'va' code point name
o src: netmap: try to count packet drops in emulated mode
o src: netmap: fix a queue length check in the generic port rx path
o src: netmap: tell the compiler to avoid reloading ring indices
o ports: remove GnuTLS workarounds from ports previously required for LibreSSL
o ports: dnsmasq 2.89[8]
o ports: dpinger 3.3[9]
o ports: lighttpd 1.4.68[10]
o ports: openssh 9.1p1[11]
o ports: openssl 1.1.1t[12]
o ports: php 8.1.15[13]

A hotfix release was issued as 23.1.1_2:

o captive portal: remove mod_evasion use which was discontinued by lighttpd
o unbound: wait for pipe in logger (contributed by kulikov-a)

Rate limiting was removed from the captive portal which was set to 250
connections by the same IP to the captive portal itself.  This can be
easily replaced by a manual firewall rule with advanced options set, e.g.
"Max established" set to 250 with destination "This Firewall".
