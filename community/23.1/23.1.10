Dear all,

As summer is approaching we release this minor update in preparation for
the upcoming 23.7 series.  We are planning the upgrade to FreeBSD 13.2
as well as offering an MVC variant of the OpenVPN integration amongst
many other improvements some of which already shipped in previous 23.1.x
releases.

is for next week to decide.  For now enjoy the sun and stay hydrated!
