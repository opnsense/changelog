Hi folks,

While the HardenedBSD 11.2 adoption is almost finished behind the scenes,
this release merely revolves around minor corrections and additions that
make your life easier.  We are also confident that 18.7.6 finally ships
the firewall alias API.

Of worthy mention are also the IPsec phase 1 changes that allow multiple
DH groups and hashes to be selected simultaneously to tackle interoperability
between different mobile client requirements.  Also check out the Nginx
plugin which has again extended its utility belt to include limiting,
permanent bans, caching and more.
