Hi there,

One more release it was indeed.  We have added considerable backend work
for improving security and adding a streaming function to avoid memory
exhaustion for data-intense data exchanges.  Note this is in preparation
for 24.1 where these will be used, but direct use in 23.7 is avoided to
lower the possibility for regressions.

The release date for 24.1 is January 30 and we approaching this differently
this time with release candidates only being available from the development
version meaning there will be no installation media before the final release.

While RC1 is mostly ready the publication is currently on hold due to chasing
down a kernel panic.  Watch out for the release notes of the RC1.  It should
be available this week with a follow-up RC2 in the following week.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: change ZFS transaction group defaults to avoid excessive disk wear[1]
o firewall: validate if GeoIP and BGP ASN targets contain at least 1 kb of data before assuming timestamp is correct
o firmware: automatically install os-squid plugin install when web proxy is enabled before major upgrade
o firmware: refactor export and scrub Unbound DNS database before major upgrade
o firmware: disallow TLS lower than 1.3 on business mirror
o openvpn: add validation for netmask greater than 29 exactly as specified in the OpenVPN source code
o backend: support streaming output using the "stream_output" handler
o backend: implement optional trust model and add extended logging
o backend: support optional configd configuration files
o mvc: add an IPPortField type
o mvc: split configdRun() in order to return a resource which the controller can stream with minimal memory consumption
o ui: fix the missing dialog padding in some modals
o ui: set a default data-size for increased readability in selectpickers
o ui: show tooltip when grid td content does not fit
o plugins: os-bind 1.29[2]
o plugins: os-ddclient 1.20[3]
o plugins: os-frr 1.38[4
o plugins: os-node_exporter 1.2[5]
o plugins: os-sunnyvalley 1.4 switches to new repository layout
o ports: py-netaddr 0.10.1
o ports: sudo 1.9.15p5


Stay safe,
