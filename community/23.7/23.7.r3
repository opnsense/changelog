Hi!

Quick release candidate update.  Last one.  Promise.

Still on track for the final release on July 31.

Here are the full patch notes:

o interfaces: on forceful IPv6 reload do not lose the event handling
o interfaces: allow primary address function to emit device used
o dhcp: print interface identifier and underlying device in "found no suitable address" warnings
o wizard: restrict to validating only IPv4 addresses


Stay safe,
