Howdy,

Today introduces a change in MTU handling for parent interfaces mostly
noticed by PPPoE use where the respective MTU values need to fit the
parent plus the additional header of the VLAN or PPPoE.  Should the
MTU already be misconfigured to a smaller value it will be used as
configured so check your configuration and clear the MTU value if you
want the system to decide about the effective parent MTU size.

Another change in far gateway handling is also included which prevents
a monitoring failure if that particular gateway was not being designated
as default during boot which made the routing table miss the essential
interface route and monitoring would always report it as down.  Now the
interface route is ensured but not only when applying the default gateway
so that it works all the time.

Also fixed was the problematic migration of the Unbound interfaces settings
which now clears the possibly unknown interfaces in order to proceed and
have Unbound up and running post update which was not the case for some
users previously.

Other reliability improvements and third party security updates are
included as well.  We also continue our effort to clean up the interface
handling code and audit the MVC model files for consistency.  A missing
change for out of the box DS-Lite support is also being tested on the
development version now and will likely hit in 23.7.6.
