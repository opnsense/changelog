Oh, hi!

This maintenance release will also be the EoL version for the 25.1 series.
It ships the latest FreeBSD SA/EN patches plus other third party security
updates and a few minor fixes.

We did see issues with the "e2fsprogs-libuuid" dependency lately obsoleted
by FreeBSD ports and while packages such as "netdata" may refuse updating
in the first update it should eventually reinstall correctly using the new
"libuuid" package.  If you see related issues make sure you are not using
multi-repo setups that still provide the obsoleted dependency.

That being said, 25.7-RC1 is already out, but RC2 likely follows tomorrow.
We are still set for a final release date of July 23.  See you on the other
side!

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: fix passing "arguments" as parameters for cron jobs
o dnsmasq: fix DomainIPField to allow IP address to be emptied
o dnsmasq: register DHCPv6 firewall rules as well
o dnsmasq: fix empty dhcp option value spawning stray comma
o firmware: remove unbound/duckdb migration script
o lang: further updates
o openvpn: validate group membership after authentication
o unbound: ignore TXT records for wildcard host entries
o plugins: os-stunnel 1.0.6 adds LDAP and NNTP to supported STARTTLS protocols (contributed by Patrick M. Hausen)
o plugins: os-zabbix-agent 1.16[1]
o plugins: os-zabbix-proxy1.13[2]
o src: ifconfig: optimise non-listing case with netlink
o src: xz: fix use-after-free in multi-threaded xz decoder[3]
o src: ena: fix misconfiguration when requesting regular LLQ[4]
o src: zfs: fix corruption in ZFS replication streams from encrypted datasets[5]
o src: libc: allow __cxa_atexit handlers to be added during __cxa_finalize[6]
o ports: libxml 2.14.4[7]
o ports: nss 3.113.1[8]
o ports: openssl 3.0.17[9]
o ports: php 8.3.23[10]
o ports: sqlite 3.50.2[11]
