Howdy,

This smallish update brings in more preparation for future features
and reworks and fixes a couple of bugs reported over the last weeks.

The patch size for 25.1.x will likely not increase in future updates
as 25.7 is near: July 23.  Save the date!

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add minimalistic interface to support SSO authentication
o system: refactor a couple of existing empty() tests to isEmpty()
o system: refactor cache flush into system_cache_flush()
o system: add backend call for returning timezones
o system: fix "weight" default fallback causing non-string return in gateway status
o interfaces: refactor newwanip IPv4/v6 scripts to reduce differences between them
o interfaces: do not call a description a "dmesg"
o interfaces: relax regex for dmesg probing to seamlessly support dmesg timestamps
o firewall: improve address family validation for rule source and destination
o firewall: fix faulty ICMP type evaluation on NAT rules
o dnsmasq: allow AliasesField values to be cleared
o dnsmasq: allow host wildcards in domain overrides again
o ipsec: add aes256-sha1 ESP proposal
o ui: backwards-compatible merge of Tabulator grid replacement changes
o plugins: os-haproxy 4.6[1]
o ports: curl 8.14.1[2]
o ports: nss 3.112[3]
o ports: openldap 2.6.10[4]
o ports: php 8.3.22[5]
o ports: python 3.11.13[6]

A hotfix release was issued as 25.1.9_2:

o system: fix route status removal buttons
o openvpn: fix server deletion in legacy page


Stay safe,
