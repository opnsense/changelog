Hi there,

For an entire decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.1, nicknamed "Ultimate Unicorn", features numerous MVC/API conversions,
improved security zones support and documentation, ZFS snapshot support,
a new UI look with a light and dark theme, PHP 8.3, FreeBSD 14.2 plus much
more.

Download links, an installation guide[1] and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o The access management was rewritten in MVC and contains behavioural changes including not rendering UNIX accounts for non-shell users. The integrated authentication via PAM has been the default for a long time so the option to disable it has been removed. The manual LDAP importer is no longer available since LDAP/RADIUS authenticators support on-demand creation and default group setup option. The "page-system-groupmanager-addprivs" privilege was removed since the page does not exist anymore. A multi-purpose privilege editor has been added under the existing "page-system-usermanager-addprivs" instead.
o PPP devices can no longer be configured on the interface settings page. To edit the device settings use the native PPP device edit page instead.
o FreeBSD 14.2 comes with the stock pf(4) behaviour regarding ICMPv6 neighbour discovery state tracking which was avoided so far in 24.7.x.
o Let's Encrypt ends support for the OCSP Must Staple extension on 30.01.2025. Issuance requests will fail if this option is still enabled past this date.
