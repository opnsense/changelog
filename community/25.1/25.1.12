Hello,

This EoL release after an EoL release is unexpected, but certainly not
unnecessary.  A bug in the shared library naming in Sqlite was briefly
introduced in FreeBSD ports going into 25.1.11 which is also a likely
cause for reported update issues with missing packages after reboot.
This was only uncovered yesterday during upgrade testing for 25.7.

To ensure proper upgrades it was decided to roll a full stable release
with added benefits like security fixes for Unbound, LibXML and a "modern
browser" fix for the firewall rules page which could not be saved under
particular circumstances.

25.7 itself is still scheduled for tomorrow pending green light during
testing its rebuild.  The firmware components have already been wired to
detect the upgrade once it becomes visible on the mirror.  There will
likely be no further hotfix this time to pick up the release.  Just check
again for updates some hours after the 25.7 release announcement to allow
for mirrors to synchronize.

Here are the full patch notes:

o firmware: add fingerprint and upgrade hint for 25.7
o firmware: upgrade scripts for automatic GDrive, IPsec and OpenVPN legacy plugin installation
o ui: replace self-closing select element (contributed by Gavin Chappell)
o ports: libxml 2.14.5[1]
o ports: sqlite SONAME fix and associated rebuilds[2]
o ports: unbound 1.23.1[3]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
