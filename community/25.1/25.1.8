Hi!

This update addresses a few security issues in third party software,
but take note that libxml2 is currently stuck in an old release in
FreeBSD ports that was decided not to be fixed there for the time being.

Dnsmasq receives more improvements as you all explore the limits of the
current implementation and what the software can still offer beyond that.
Thank you for all the good feedback on this front!

The FreeBSD kernel was updated with a number of upstream stable commits
while we get closer to evaulating the jump to a newer FreeBSD release for
25.7.

Lastly, we are preparing for a historic moment: offering privilege separation
for the GUI meaning the web server can stop running as a root user.  This
may still be optional in the next major version, but it makes fixing the
remaining incompatibilities much easier.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: fix regression in setGroupMembership()
o system: add "Source Networks" option to groups to restrict connectivity to web GUI
o system: remove defunct "sshlogingroup" OpenSSH option because non-admins are no longer permitted shell access
o system: reduce font size in thermal sensors widget tooltip (contributed by indeed-a-genius)
o system: allow access to cached watcher gateway status
o system: implement "force_down" failover support
o system: implement base_bootgrid_table in user, group and priv templates
o system: balance fastcgi servers a bit better
o system: check private key matches provided certificate data
o system: introduce a "wwwonly" user and group and related privilege separation preparations
o interfaces: convert bridge configuration to MVC/API
o interfaces: remove unused is_interface_assigned()
o firewall: use CIDR notation for specifying masks to dnctl (contributed by Daniel Tang)
o firewall: improve dummynet_stats.py parsing of mask descriptor lines (contributed by Daniel Tang)
o firewall: exclude interfaces with local links only when generating force gateway rules
o firewall: fix missing lock while refactoring config for group changes
o firewall: properly synchronize load order for shaper when reloading configuration
o firewall: add toggle log command in automation
o firewall: since bogons source writes a comment first prefix our exclusions too
o firewall: tighten address / range validation for aliases
o firewall: align alias tokenizer options with the ones in our base template
o captive portal: align accounting session timeout with API
o captive portal: balance fastcgi servers a bit better
o captive portal: do not share a fastcgi socket with web GUI
o dnsmasq: add missing constraint and fix template for boot options
o dnsmasq: reload filter on service reload
o dnsmasq: add command in leases view to create DHCP reservations
o dnsmasq: hide static mode in DHCP range in advanced mode
o dnsmasq: set default to empty lease time for DHCP hosts to allow for defaults
o dnsmasq: add "no-resolv" option to prevent use of system defined DNS servers
o dnsmasq: validate IP address usage for DHCP registrations
o dnsmasq: add validation preventing end address to be empty for IPV4 non-static ranges
o dnsmasq: when "dhcp-fqdn" is active, set all DHCP domains as local
o dnsmasq: add checkbox to hosts that can set domains as local
o dnsmasq: allow either empty IP or empty hostname for DHCP hosts
o dnsmasq: fix wildcard host handling
o dnsmasq: add overlay to conditionally remove values based on DHCP option type
o ipsec: add "cacert" option in remote auth section and allow spaces and wildcards in id fields
o ipsec: be more verbose when modifying SPDs
o isc-dhcp: show tracking interfaces when enabled and offer an explicit disable
o kea-dhcp: add static_routes validation (contributed by Dr. Uwe Meyer-Gruhl)
o openvpn: remove deprecated use of is_interface_assigned() in legacy client/server
o unbound: remove "inplace" in chained assignment (contributed by dstapa)
o mvc: deny whitespaces, asterisks and slashes in HostnameField
o mvc: support array response type in session->get()
o plugins: os-caddy 2.0.1[1]
o plugins: os-crowdsec 1.0.10[2]
o plugins: os-sunnyvalley 1.5 switches mirror domain
o src: pf: explicitly NULL state key pointers
o src: pf: fix panic in pf_return()
o src: pf: do not use state keys after pf_state_insert()
o src: netlink, socket, sctp, tcp, udp: assorted upstream stable changes
o src: in6_control_ioctl: correctly report errors from SIOCAIFADDR_IN6
o src: axgbe: add support for Yellow Carp Ethernet device
o src: dhclient: keep two clocks
o src: rtw88, rtw89: merge Realtek driver based on Linux v6.14
o src: iwlwififw: remove Intel iwlwifi firmware from src.git
o ports: curl 8.14.0[3]
