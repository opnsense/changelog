Howdy,

This release improves overall RADIUS support, moves the captive portal
from IPFW to PF, creates visibility of external certificate sources in
the system and offers a glimpse into the filter automation GUI revamp
which could one day replace the remaining static firewall rules edit pages.

Speaking of static pages: MVC/API conversions are almost 80% complete now
and we would really like to continue that trend.  Also brace for impact
as we crash-land Dnsmasq DHCP support in a stable release within the next
90 days!
