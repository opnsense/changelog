Hello, hello!

This update features a number of improvements such as link-local support
for bridges, HA sync consolidation, adding local CAs to the trusted SSL
certificates for most of the system download capabilities, plugin-based
PAM authentication rework for IPsec and the web proxy as well as third
party fixes for hostapd / wpa_supplicant 2.8 and Suricata 4.1.4.

Python 3 migration is also underway now which requires to pull in both
Python versions which may be heavy on embedded Nano installs, but we
cannot see another way for this tedious task which will probably stretch
into 19.7 to be fully carried out in 20.1.

And speaking of 20.1: This is the first of many reminders that 20.1 will
discontinue the i386 (Intel 32 Bit) franchise as discussed a number of
times within the community over the years.  Our hope is that ARM64 will
make a viable replacement.  But that is for another time.

As you may have noticed the project has not been delivering releases every
other week and there are a number of reasons for it:

Security-wise we have not had a lot of necessary third-party software
updates.  Feature-wise we are sitting on a number of improvements for the
upcoming 19.7 series that will trickle into 19.1.x now, but that have also
required larger preparations and testing in the meantime.  On the community
side of the spectrum, sponsored by our partner m.a.x. it, we have started
to work on better default gateway switching which led to an overall gateway
integration rework and then quickly to interface handling restructuring,
which in turn led to improving plugin capabilities of core services
(OpenVPN, IPsec, Unbound, Dnsmasq, DHCPD, Dpinger).  Looking at it now it
has been the largest rework so far on code established many years ago and
only occasionally patched.  We hope this shows our dedication to the code
base even when things are not always 100% bug free.  If you feel like
pitching in now is a good time to try the development version and let us
know about how it performs.

Without further ado, here are the full patch notes:

o system: HA sync cleanup removes opportunistic syncs in random GUI pages (use HA status page to sync and restart remote services)
o system: support for syncing alias and VHID to the slave

o system: more reliable load and sync for LDAP attributes (contributed by Indrajit Raychaudhuri)
o system: migrate health graph scripts to Python 3.6
o interfaces: properly add and remove IPv6 trackers after interface apply
o interfaces: validate prefix ID of IPv6 trackers so that each ID is unique
o interfaces: display "0x" in prefix ID field so that it is clear that value is in hex
o interfaces: fix passing VLAN name in interface_virtual_create()
o interfaces: fix group-related bugs and allow digits and underscores in name, but no more than 15 characters
o interfaces: allow link-local address on bridges via optional setting
o interfaces: PPP-related code cleanups
o firewall: prevent double-escaping of text in rules page
o firewall: handle IDNA encode failures in aliases
o firewall: alias import / export option
o captive portal: update to bootstrap 3.4.1

o ipsec: implemented wildcard includes (contributed by Mark Plomer)
o ipsec: only apply mobile PFS to mobile phase 2
o ipsec: restyle mobile settings a little
o ipsec: switch XAuth to PAM
