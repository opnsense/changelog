Hi there,

This update brings a smaller number of fixes and improvements as well as
the latest PHP version update.

With a heavy heart we disable E_WARNING messages in the PHP error reporting.
It has been implemented in 2015 to improve code quality and it did just that,
but with the latest PHP 7.2 jump in 19.1.5 it causes problems around the
newly added count() usage warning messages.  We plan to bring back E_WARNING
usage in 19.7.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: let dashboard only accept its own POST requests
o system: remove obsolete symlink to opnsense-auth
o system: skip PHP E_WARNING log level until 19.7
o system: numerous PHP 7.2 warning fixes
o dhcp: DHCPD server check in relay only if interface is active
o dnsmasq: skip empty custom options
o intrusion prevention: do not drop flowbits:noalert rules
o unbound: add ACL entries for OpenVPN by default
o mvc: controller cleanups in firewall shaper, web proxy and captive portal
o plugins: numerous PHP 7.2 warning fixes
o plugins: os-freeradius 1.9.2 fixes LDAP group filter and EAP certificates write (contributed by Alexander Harm)
o plugins: os-nginx 1.11[1]
o ports: php 7.2.17[2]
o ports: py-certifi 2019.3.9[3]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
