Good day to all,

This update is going forward with a larger batch of firmware update
improvements that are important for 18.7 and beyond, addressing the
former lack of error handling, check for update speed and API check
capabilities for major upgrades.

Intrusion detection syslog behaviour changes slightly after a number
of good discussions, meaning that now syslog is always on, but fast
log alert info is steered by the former syslog option making the
option the best of both worlds and enabling future syslog export,
which is now also available in the development version.

Last but not least we want to mention the work done on allowing detached
UI development which is now included in the release.  For more information
check out the UI development tools[1] that have been released alongside.

There is more preparation underway for 18.7, but that info will have to
wait as it eludes the context of this announcement.  Feel free to
frequently check the milestone progress in the forums[2] in the meantime.
