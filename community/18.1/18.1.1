Hi everyone,

18.1.1 addresses issues in the previous release, while also updating
the packages and plugins.  Most notably, a Python library change made
intrusion detection rules fetch fail previously and we fixed GUI and
backend behaviour for two special NAT cases.

Here are the full patch notes:

o firewall: ignore target port alias in port forwards when it equals the destination
o firewall: align outbound NAT address output to edit page
o firewall: use first region for country in GeoIP category instead of last one
o system: improve layout of gateway status labels (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o system: improve order of group / user setup as "wheel" was not added correctly on save
o dashboard: touch device improvements in widgets (contributed by NOYB)
o opendns: always refresh the setting on save
o openvpn: open links in a new tab (contributed by Fabian Franz)
o ui: system-wide HTML compliance improvements (contributed by NOYB)
o plugins: arp-scan 1.1 improves interface search (contributed by Giuseppe De Marco)
o plugins: os-dyndns 1.6 fixes Route 53 IPv6 usage (contributed by theq86)
