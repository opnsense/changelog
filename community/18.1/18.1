@ January 29, 2018

Hello good folks of the Internet,

For more than 3 years now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD
security, fast adoption of upstream software updates as well as
clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We humbly present to you the sum of another major iteration of the
OPNsense firewall.  Over the second half of 2017 well over 500 changes
have made it into this release, nicknamed "Groovy Gecko".  Most notably,
the firewall NAT rules have been reworked to be more flexible and usable
via plugins, which is going to pave the way for subsequent API works on
the core firewall functionality.  For more details please find the attached
list of changes below.

The upgrade track from 17.7 will be available later today.  Please be
patient.  :)

Meltdown and Spectre patches are currently being worked on in FreeBSD[1],
but there is no reliable timeline.  We will keep you up to date through
the usual channels as more news become available.  Hang in there!

These are the most prominent changes since version 17.7:

o FreeBSD 11.1, PHP 7.1 and jQuery 3 migration
o Realtek vendor NIC driver version 1.94
o Portable NAT before IPsec support
o Local group restriction feature in OpenVPN and IPsec
o OpenVPN multi-remote support for clients
o Strict interface binding for SSH and web GUI
o Improved MVC tabs and general page layout
o Shared forwarding now works on IPv6, in conjunction with "try-forwarding" and improved reply-to multi-WAN behaviour
o Easy-to-use update cache support for Linux and Windows in web proxy
o Intrusion detection alert improvements and plugin support for new rulesets (ET Pro, Snort VRT)
o Revamped HAProxy plugin with introduction pages
o Moved interface selection to menu and quick search for firewall rules, DHCP and wireless status
o Alias backend rewrite for future extensibility
o Plugin-capable firewall NAT rules
o Migration of system routes UI and backend to MVC (also available via API)
o Reverse DNS support for insight reporting (also available via API)
o Fully rewritten firewall live log in MVC (also available via API)
o New plugins: zerotier, mdns-repeater, collectd, telegraf, clamav, c-icap, tor, siproxd, web-proxy-sso, web-proxy-useracl, postfix, rspamd, redis, iperf, arp-scan, zabbix-proxy, frr, node_exporter
