Hi there,

With a bit of delay we bring to you the usual mix of security and
reliability updates.  It is of note that the OpenVPN advisory tracked
as CVE-2020-15078 does not affect the provided version 2.4.11, but the
security audit will falsely flag it as vulnerable because the source
of the audit is FreeBSD where OpenVPN was migrated to 2.5 series already.

Plans for upcoming 21.1.x versions include a swift Phalcon 4 migration as
well as Python 3.8 and PHP 7.4 updates.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add audit log target and move related syslog messages there
o system: set HSTS max-age to 1 year (contributed by Maurice Walker)
o system: fix restore copy in console recovery

o firewall: add live log filter templates feature (contributed by kulikov-a)
o dhcp: compress expanded IPv6 lease addresses for clean match with system
o dhcp: on the GUI pages avoid the use of dhcpd_dhcp_configure()
o dnsmasq: use dhcpd_staticmap() for lease registration
o firmware: opnsense-patch now also invalidates the menu cache
o ipsec: add "keyingtries" phase 1 configuration option
o ipsec: automatic outbound NAT rules missed mobile clients
o ipsec: fix typo in autogenerated rules for virtual IP use
