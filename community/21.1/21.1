Hi there,

For more than 6 years, OPNsense is driving innovation through modularising
and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable firmware
upgrades, multi-language support, HardenedBSD security, fast adoption of
upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

21.1, nicknamed "Marvelous Meerkat", is the relentless continuation of
open source dedication.  The last 6 years were not always easy, but we
are happy to be where we are now and have the community to thank for it.

New and improved are the firewall rules and NAT categories, the traffic
graphs supporting IPv6 along with a visual refresh, intrusion detection
rule management by policies, an alias for MAC addresses and NAT over IPsec
with all phase 2 you could ever want.  Last but not least, the serial image
now supports UEFI as well.

For those wondering, the WireGuard plugin has been available since 2019 and
receives continuous improvements by its maintainer and various users alike.
And that is unlikey to change in the future.  ;)

As we continue to deprecate custom configuration inputs for a number of
reasons, Dnsmasq has been switched to a pluggable file-based approach[1]
with Unbound to follow in the upcoming 21.7 series.

Download links, an installation guide[2] and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.
