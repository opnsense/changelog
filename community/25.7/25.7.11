A happy new year to all of you!

25.7.11 comes at a strange point in time but we will try to offer a bit of
familiarity and common sense as we probably all need more of this.  <3

This release brings the new host discovery service which resolves and remembers
MAC addresses for IPv4 and IPv6 hosts in your connected networks and provides
this data for the firewall MAC aliases and captive portal clients.  It is now
enabled by default, but you can choose to opt out by disabling the automatic
discovery option.

A lot of work went into IPv6 improvements over the holidays as is tradition
with the help of users debugging their networks during that time.  A number
of kernel fixes have been supplied and dhcp6c will also receive a larger update
in 26.1 soon.

The changes are otherwise clustered around preparation for the major upgrade
which brings an number of fundamental changes with the ongoing removal of
ISC-DHCP from core.  A plugin is already available through the development
version and should auto-install.  If not make sure you install it before
attempting a reboot there.  For the stable version everything is as it was.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: add tooltip explaining active status in snapshots
