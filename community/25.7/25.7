Hi there,

For over a decade now, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

25.7, nicknamed "Visionary Viper", features reusable and thoroughly
revamped frontend code, an SFTP backup plugin, experimental privilege
separation for the GUI, JSON container support for aliases, a new and
improved firewall automation GUI, performance enhancements especially
for numerous aliases being used at once, Dnsmasq DHCP support, Kea DHCPv6
support, Greek as a new language, FreeBSD 14.3 plus much more.

Download links, an installation guide[1] and the checksums for the images
can be found below as well.

o plugins: os-strongswan-legacy 1.0 for legacy IPsec components support
o src: FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE-p1 plus assorted stable/14 networking commits[7]

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

o Deprecated Google Drive backups due to upstream policy changes and moved to plugins for existing users.
o API URLs registered in the default ACLs have been switched from "camleCase" to "snake_case".
o API grid return values now offer "%field" for a value description when available.  "field" will now always be the literal value from the configuration. The API previously returned a display value for some field types, but not all.
o Reverted tunables "hw.ibrs_disable" and "vm.pmap.pti" to FreeBSD defaults.  If you want these set differently, then add them with an explicit value.
o While the mirror dns-root.de has been removed it will not be stripped from a running configuration and may keep working for a while longer.  To ensure updates, however, please choose a different mirror at your own convenience.
o Moved OpenVPN legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
o Moved IPsec legacy to plugins as a first step to deprecation.
