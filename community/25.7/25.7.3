Howdy!

The Tabulator introduction into MVC grid views was a major success with
virtually no complaints.  Did you notice?  Maybe you will now that more
features have been unlocked: Dnsmasq grids group by interfaces, firewall
automation rules now can show folders using categories and row count default
and selections have been increased.  A few performance and UX tweaks were
carried out as well while at it.

StrongSwan moves to version 6.0.1 now after elaborate testing.  The
"make_before_break" value was flipped from off to on in their version
jump, but the settings will still default to off for everyone unless
already otherwise configured.

Here are the full patch notes:
