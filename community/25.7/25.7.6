Hi there,

The usual round of additions and reliability fixes is being rounded off with
Suricata version 8 and a new package manager version 2 almost two years in the
making -- at least for our project.

Please be aware that during the update check the new package manager will be
installed, but will fail to report the update status like it always had before
and so you will end up with an error that will require checking for updates
again.  The fix is in is update, but impossible to install without upgrading
the package manager first.  We hope this will only be a minor inconvenience
during the process.

Syslog-ng is also being updated and includes a fix that previously prevented
2.9.x from shipping since it would hang the boot during daemonize.  Many
thanks to the authors for quickly picking this up and shipping a fixed version!
