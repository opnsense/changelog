Hi folks,

This week's 15.7.7 is a subtle maintenance release to wrap up remaining
issues that came in via crash reports since 15.7.6.

Furthermore, we are not aware of any security issues in third party software.

Here are the full patch notes:

o interfaces: VLAN on top of LAGG now correctly overrides flags on the actual parent interfaces
o system: added firmware crypto flavour and mirror selection to general settings
o logs: add missing prototype.js to fix pie charts display (contributed by Chong Cheung)
o languages: updated German (42% complete) and Japanese (80% complete)
o crash reporter: fixed assorted minor coding errors/warnings
o system: improved LDAP bindings and user import (including fixes by Christian Schonberg)
o proxy: added option to ignore subnets from getting into the access log
o proxy: fixed automatic startup on /var MFS
o intrusion detection: fixed automatic startup on /var MFS
o menu: fix collapse/expand for DHCP (contributed by Chong Cheung)
o menu: added logout option to user menu


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
