Hi there,

Time for the weekly update.  :)

15.7.19 is a smaller maintenance release with a backend switch for IPsec
reporting and a couple of minor fixes.  With the help of the community, we're
also improving the consistency of the GUI translation with more commits
already in the works.

Notable from a development version perspective are the API authentication
and the revived voucher support for our new captive portal.  This means two
more roadmap items already finished for 16.1.

Here are the full patch notes:

o ports: sudo 1.8.15[1], sqlite 3.9.2[2]
o aliases: make url tables useable
o interfaces: fix faulty GUI caching issues[3]
o ipsec: obey force nat traversal
o ipsec: switch status page and widget from deprecated SMP to VICI interface for reliable output
o ipsec: fixed remote network input validation
o status: show more raw ipfw info in the commands section
o config: don't use notices in early/low level code
o languages: a large number of old and new strings is now being properly translated (with contributions from Franz Fabian and Frederic Lietart)
o languages: translation strings no longer use obfuscated argument reordering by default
o languages: updated German and French to a newer version from translate.opnsense.org
o captive portal/development: added a new voucher implementation
o api/development: added API key authentication mechanism[4]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
