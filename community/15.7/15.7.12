Greetings everyone,

The vacation time is over for most of us, and so we do roll on into
what is going to be a busy autumn.  As we haven't had a release in 2
weeks a longer list of changes has accumulated.  Most prominently, we
have a security advisory for FreeBSD that may allow privilege
escalation on amd64 architectures.  More security-related updates are
available for LibreSSL, Bind and PHP.

We've also been able to iron out the few IPsec configuration problems
left related to the page rewrite thanks to relentless testing by
Frank Wall and others.  We appreciate any help in doing the same for
the new Firewall pages we have staged in our development version[12].
Here is the full list of changes:

o src: local privilege escalation in IRET handler[1]
o src: disable ixgbe(4) flow-director support[2]
o src: insufficient check of unsupported pkg(7) signature methods[3]
o ports: libressl 2.2.3[4], bind 9.10.2P4[5], openldap 2.4.42[6]
o ports: radvd 1.15[7], lighttpd 1.4.37[8], squid 3.5.8[9]
o ports: php 5.6.13[10], php-suhosin 0.9.38[11]
o dhcp: use reverse mask instead of reverse address in config
o dns resolver: honour log verbosity toggle
o ssh: remove ssh1 key from generating, it is no longer supported in openssh
o filter: remove the unused snort2c table from generated rules
o xmlrpc: properly regenerate /etc/hosts on sync
o openvpn: fix TLS authentication option reset
o ipsec: proper redirect after apply in mobile tab
o ipsec: fix behaviour of enable rekey and enable reauth
o ipsec: only suffix connection number with sequence with multiple entries
o ipsec: fix diagnostics to be able to connect multi phase2 IKEv1 entries
o ipsec: fix Call to undefined function filter_configure()
o dashboard: traffic graph highlights are now branded in orange
o theme: render dropdown boxes a bit better
o theme: partial fix for wrapped tab display
o crash reporter: fix spurious crash report after actual submission
o crash reporter: assorted fixes for warnings and errors in the code
o crash reporter: improve submit/dismiss button layout


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
