Hello fellows,

Today we proudly present to you 15.7.20, which includes several improvements
and fixes in all areas.  Notable from a development perspective are the
opnsense-bootstrap tool, which can install the latest OPNsense version on a
FreeBSD 10.1.  Additionally, the development branch offers a sneak preview of
Suricata in true IPS mode!  Instructions on how to test it can be found in
the forum[9].
