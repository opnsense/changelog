Hello everyone,

To improve migration to the next version we are releasing this update
back to back with 22.1.  There is no immediate need to upgrade so plenty
of time to read and prepare.

Suffice to say this will be the last update of the 21.7 series.  Thank
you and see you on the other side.  :)

o firewall: correctly handle IPv6 NAT in states view
o firewall: skip rule ID for NAT type log entries (contributed by kulikov-a)
o firewall: support "no scrub" option in normalisation rules

o intrusion detection: update to ET-Open to version 6
o intrusion detection: prevent config migration from crashing
o lang: update translations for Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, and Turkish
o captive portal: prevent session removal crashing when no IP address was registered
