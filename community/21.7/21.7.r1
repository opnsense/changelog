Hi there,

For more than 6 and a half years, OPNsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple and reliable
firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption of upstream software
updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD licensing.

We thank all of you for helping test, shape and contribute to the project!
We know it would not be the same without you.  <3
