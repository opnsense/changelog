@ September 07, 2021

Good morning,

Today the following CVEs are being addressed:

CVE-2021-3711, CVE-2021-3712, CVE-2021-23840, CVE-2021-23841

Please note that the Let's Encrypt client plugin is now called
ACME client since acme.sh version 3 does support multiple providers.

Apart from the usual batch of fixes the work on RSS (receive side
scaling) is progressing and groundwork has already made it to the
kernel along with the libnetmap library for allowing better scaling
in netmap mode along with it.  At this point, however, RSS is not
yet enabled and there is no impact on existing setups.  That will
likely change with one of the next stable versions in this series.

On the other hand, the work for FreeBSD 13 migration in 22.1 is
ongoing as well to be able to test this rather sooner than later.
In this iteration we will take the time to look at shared forwarding
edge cases and have already upstreamed a number of patches that
have been accumulated over the last couple of years to keep our
code base light and tidy.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: default RSS widget feed to forum announcements
o system: add missing ACL for Syslog targets page
o system: fix unescaped source field used for password in backup plugins
o system: reload FreeBSD services when reloading all services from console

o interfaces: correct indent in dhclient configuration
o firewall: allow to specify port ranges for outgoing NAT (contributed by Nikolay Denev)
o firewall: fix long comment preventing IPFW reload (contributed by Robin Schneider)
o firewall: fix compare interfaces (contributed by Smart-Soft)
o firmware: opnsense-patch can now patch installer and updater files
o firmware: opnsense-update -c option now honours the -f option
o firmware: opnsense-update improvements for mirror manipulation options

o firmware: replace php version_compare() call with pkg-version shell command
o firmware: correctly announce major upgrade reboot in status return
o firmware: do not fetch GeoIP database from business mirrors without a subscription

o src: fix remote code execution in ggatec(8)[4]
o src: fix libfetch out of bounds read[5]
o src: fix multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities[6][7]
o ports: ifinfo 13.0
o ports: libressl 3.3.4[8]

o ports: strongswan 5.9.3[13]
o ports: sudo 1.9.7p2[14]
