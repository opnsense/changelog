Hello,

FreeBSD security advisories and an issue with Intel-based ixgbe driver
with "ifconfig -v" stalls keep this release rolling.  Also note that
OpenSSH was updated to version 8.8 which deprecates ssh-rsa usage which
is mainly an issue for client access from the OPNsense system to the
outside and can be amended as per the suggestions in the respective
release notes.

And as promised the development version includes the upgrade path to
the 22.1-BETA1 release.  This will be an online-beta with a few iterations
over the FreeBSD 13 stable branch and eventually move to FreeBSD 13.1
release as that becomes available.

Highlights for 22.1 already include:

o Suricata Netmap version 14 support for multi-gigabit speed in IPS mode with RSS enabled
o Separate VLAN MAC spoofing and permanent promiscuous mode setting
o Tunable analytics provide automatic descriptions and type
o IPsec tunnel overview ported to MVC with pagination
o Proofpoint Emerging Threats rules for Suricata 5.0
o Removed opportunistic interface address read functions
o Console-based LAGG configuration support
o Removed state killing on gateway failure feature
o Improved firmware update capabilities
o No-bind service awareness for virtual IPs
o FreeBSD 13 stable branch
o RFC 5424 and severity support in logs
o Clog support has been removed
o And more...

Please note that the beta version will always be available for upgrade when
switching to the development version.  At this point no stable packages
are provided and this includes plugins.  These will become available as
the release candidate is released in early January 2022.

All feedback is welcome but keep in mind that there are still a number of
moving parts ahead.  Upgrade responsibly.
