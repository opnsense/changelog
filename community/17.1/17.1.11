Hi all,

An IPv6 problem has finally been fixed which could prevent reclaiming
address leases during an interface reload, especially when OpenVPN was
running.  Thanks to everyone involved in tracking this down!  Also,
the last bits for the new GUI major upgrade feature are now in place.
The 17.7 upgrade path will be unlocked on July 31, which will require
installing one tiny final update.

Here are the full patch notes:

o firmware: added major GUI upgrade code for upcoming 17.7 release
o firmware: added major GUI cron upgrade parameter "ALLOW_RISKY_MAJOR_UPGRADE"
o interfaces: dhcp6c can now properly reload without leaking its listening socket to e.g. OpenVPN
o rc: allow to optionally prevent launch of configd via rc.conf variable
o openvpn: normalise line endings of used certificates
o openvpn: fix config handling in GUI pages for PHP 7.1
o plugins: os-quagga 1.3.2 (contributed by Fabian Franz and Michael Muenz)
o ports: perl 5.24.2[1]
o ports: strongswan 5.5.3[2]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
