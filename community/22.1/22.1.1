Good morning/afternoon/evening,

The first stable release brings in minor fixes from FreeBSD and instant
log file visibility for files without severity written which can happen
for individual plugins.

We have also gone ahead to restructure the interface code further to resolve
dependencies between configured devices and interfaces automatically and
the bundled development version is worth a try for everyone having issues
with GIF/GRE not coming up after boot.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: changing interface gateway was ignored during route reconfiguration
o system: allow to configure SSH setting PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms (contributed by Manuel Faux)
o system: add backward compatibility for reading logs without severity by default (contributed by kulikov-a)
