@ July 07, 2022

Good morning,

Today we are shipping small reliability improvements and a few security
updates for bundled packages.  Of special note is the upgrade of Phalcon 5,
Python 3.9 and move of the StrongSwan vici library into a separate package.

This release will be the last of the 22.1 series.  The release candidate
for 22.7 will be available next week and the release date for the final
version is July 28.  Users wishing to try the release candidate can reach
it from the development version or reinstall from the provided images.

A hotfix will be issued on the 28th to enable the upgrade path, but depending
on testing and mirror availability this might be up to 24 hours after the
intial image release of 22.7.
