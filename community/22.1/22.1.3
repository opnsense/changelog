Hi all,

This update includes groundwork for interface handling improvements
making the boot more flexible in complex interface assignment scenarios
involving GIF, GRE and bridge devices.

Please note this update does not include the current OpenSSL security
advisory due to overlapping time schedules.  22.1.4 will include these
and will likely be released next week.

Here are the full patch notes:

o system: remove "all" group handling code forgotten in 2015
o interfaces: resolve device/interface interdependency on boot
o interfaces: do not update VIPs on dynamic address changes
o interfaces: remove unused reference and return value from interface_carp_configure()
o interfaces: remove unused reference from interface_ipalias_configure()
o interfaces: stop IPv6 from reacting to simple stop/detach/down events via rc.linkup
o interfaces: introduce ifctl helper for future use
o firewall: allow per-rule adaptive timeouts (contributed by kulikov-a)
o dhcp: stream-read log and leases files for "dhcpd update prefixes" action
o firmware: use opnsense-update for version info in update checks
o firmware: independently check for available upgrade sets
o firmware: separate the "needs_reboot" and "upgrade_needs_reboot" check flags
o firmware: add URL return feature to changelog script
o firmware: improve the connectivity audit
o ipsec: clean up stale CA certificates on reconfigure
o plugins: os-ddclient 1.3[1]
o plugins: os-freeradius templating generation fix
o ports: dnspython 2.2.1[2]
o ports: dpinger 3.2[3]
o ports: expat 2.4.7[4]
o ports: krb5 1.19.3[5]
o ports: nss 3.76[6]
o ports: openssh 8.9p1[7]
o ports: sudo 1.9.10[8]
o ports: syslog-ng 3.36.1[9]


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team
