Hello,

This release adds GUI support for Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) and
syncookies as per virtue of the FreeBSD 13 operating system.  The work
to modernise the interfaces subsystem and improve the new ddclient dynamic
DNS plugin are also progressing.

Due to signs of decay in the build infrastructure, license nitpicking
in FreeBSD ports and the upcoming OpenSSL 3 release (which will complicate
things most likely) we have decided to discontinue LibreSSL at the end of
this year meaning there will be no more LibreSSL flavour starting with
version 23.1.  Non-essential software will no longer be manually fixed and
provided as binary packages if broken by upstream from this point on.

Since 2015 we have been working on functional LibreSSL support with steady
means, but 7 years later and OpenSSL making an effort through numerous
ways we are sad to give up this alternative since we do not see LibreSSL
being used and properly integrated in software projects as often anymore.
It has been a slow but steady decline for the past 2 years that also has
to do with a LibreSSL release cycle tailored for OpenBSD in particular and
OpenSSL library integration quality, which is almost impossible to improve
upon in complex third-party software projects.  We simply cannot afford the
time for it any longer.

All users are able to update to the OpenSSL flavour without issues now or
at any later given point.
