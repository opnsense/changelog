Changelog History of OPNsense
=============================

This repository holds the full changelog history of OPNsense as
text-friendly documents, but that can be rendered more gracefully
in the GUI.

The changelogs are distributed as a fully contained and signed
set including amendments for previous versions.  That way, the
changelogs are resilient against phising attacks but can still
be updated as needed.

Corrections in the form of pull requests are welcome.

The feature was first released in OPNSense 16.7.11 in December 2016.

The format is as follows:

File name is the release name

"@" line is the date of the annoucement: "Month Day, Year"

Single line skips are ignored, double line skips are paragraphs

"o" is transformed into bullet lists, lines with indent are continued

"[x]" are links in text in postfix notation, prefix notation is the link

"--" at the start of the line is a comment and doesn't count as a skip

"#" at the start of the line displays all line content as is

Literal text that starts with "http[s]?://" is hyperlinked


Stay safe,
Franco on behalf of the OPNsense team
